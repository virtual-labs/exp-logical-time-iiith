### Aim of the experiment

Measuring time is important for practical reasons â€” timestamps for transactions, backup, and ordering content. It is vital for the design and analysis of the systems themselves. This measurement derives from the *ordering* of events (that of a clock tick) themselves. Logical clocks avoid this intermediate representation by exploiting ordering in an element of a system and between elements in a system. The simplest such clock is scalar logical time.
